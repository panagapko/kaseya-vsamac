# Kaseya VSA Agent Tool for macOS
## Features
### Agent Uninstall
Cleanly remove the Kaseya VSA agent and all related files/folders on macOS. This is particularly useful after a failed agent install as there will be files left behind that will prevent or hinder another installation. Use this uninstaller to reset back to a clean slate.

### Agent Download & Install
Allows you to quickly and easily (and verbosely!) install the VSA agent on macOS. All you have to do is enter the ID# for a macOS agent package you've already created in VSA. The script checks the system for common issues, fetches the agent installer, and then performs a verbose install via the terminal.
